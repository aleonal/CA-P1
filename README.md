# s18arch-project1
Project 1 for Computer Architecture 1

Update 1.0
- llist.c and llist.h are closely related to the files provided through the
"linked list demo".
- Added ability to delete single node from linked list.

Update 2.0
- Fixed llist.c and llist.h to implement linked lists correctly.
- Added file reader for the program.
- Tested the program with test file "employee_database.txt"

Update 3.0
- Fixed bugs, other than the program not being able to take non-integer input.


*Notes*
- Linked List implementation was mostly derived from LLDemo, provided in-class.
- File algorithms were derived from:
